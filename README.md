To use this ROS package you should have Ardupilot, Ardupilot_gazebo plugin, MAVROS and MAVLink.
On top of that, you should have a gazebo world with a quadrotor.
Add this ROS package to a catkin workspace for using it.
To run the simulation, you need to use the command "rosrun iq_gnc eight_shape", or "rosrun iq_gnc square". The src folder in iq_gnc contains the "eight_shape.cpp" and "square.cpp".
